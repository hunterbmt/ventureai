To move forward, we need to consider how to operationalize these strategies, taking into account the resources, investments, and partnerships required. We should also think about the potential barriers and how to mitigate them. Let's continue our discussion by focusing on the practical steps we can take to implement these strategies, and how we can measure progress and success in these areas.

Sumira: While the move into **quantum computing** and **sustainable semiconductor manufacturing** may seem like a competitive edge, we must be cautious not to fall into the trap of buzzword-driven development. Quantum computing, while promising, is still a largely theoretical field with many practical hurdles to overcome. We need to ensure that any investment in this area is not just for the sake of appearing cutting-edge but is backed by a clear path to commercial viability.

As for sustainable manufacturing, it's not enough to simply adopt green practices. We must innovate beyond what's already being done. Why not explore the creation of completely closed-loop systems for semiconductor production, where waste is minimized to the point of non-existence? This would be a true differentiator in the market.

**Open innovation** hubs are a dime a dozen these days. If we're to establish one, it must have a unique value proposition. Perhaps we should focus on attracting not just talent but also unconventional thinkers who can cross-pollinate ideas between disparate fields, leading to breakthroughs that a traditional semiconductor background might not yield.

Regarding **strategic partnerships**, we should be selective and aim for alliances that allow us to not just share knowledge but also challenge and possibly disrupt current industry standards. We need partners who are willing to take risks and break new ground, not those who are content with the status quo.

In operationalizing these strategies, we must be prepared to pivot and adapt. Metrics for success should include not just financial returns or market share but also innovation indices, such as patents filed, research papers published, and new technologies commercialized. Let's not just measure progress by traditional means but also by our ability to redefine the industry.

YC: **Sumira**, your cautionary perspective is well-taken. It's crucial that we don't get caught up in the allure of buzzwords without substantiating our strategies with concrete plans and potential for commercial success. The idea of a **closed-loop system** for semiconductor manufacturing is particularly compelling and could indeed set Singapore apart as a leader in environmental innovation within the industry.

The point about **open innovation hubs** is also important. We need to ensure that any such hub in Singapore doesn't just blend into the background of similar initiatives but stands out by fostering truly interdisciplinary collaboration and attracting not just talent, but mavericks who can think outside the conventional boundaries.

In terms of **strategic partnerships**, I agree that we should seek out relationships that are symbiotic and challenge the norm. Partners who are willing to take calculated risks and innovate will be key to our success.

For operationalizing these strategies, we must be agile and ready to adapt. The metrics for success you've suggested, including innovation indices, are excellent. They will help us track our progress in meaningful ways that reflect our commitment to leading the industry, not just in market share but in setting new standards and redefining what's possible.

Let's ensure that our strategies are not only ambitious but also have a clear roadmap to implementation, with built-in flexibility to evolve as we learn and grow. This will help us maintain a competitive edge and achieve our goal of making Singapore a global leader in the semiconductor industry.

We should also consider how we can incentivize companies to adopt these practices.

In terms of **open innovation**, we need to define what makes our hub unique. We should establish clear criteria for the types of projects and thinkers we want to attract and determine how we will support their work. This could involve setting up grant programs, providing access to specialized equipment, or facilitating partnerships with larger industry players.

When it comes to **strategic partnerships**, we need to be clear about what we want to achieve from these alliances. We should outline the criteria for selecting partners and the goals for these partnerships, whether it's co-developing new technologies, accessing new markets, or sharing R&D costs.

Finally, we need to establish clear **metrics for success**. These should include traditional financial metrics, but also measures of innovation output, such as the number of new patents filed, the number of research collaborations formed, and the number of new products brought to market.

Let's start by assigning responsibilities for each of these areas and setting up a timeline for when we want to achieve these goals. We need to be as detailed and thorough in our planning as we are ambitious in our thinking.
David: The insights shared have been incredibly valuable. To structure our conversation and ensure we're creating actionable plans, I suggest we use the **Starbursting** brainstorming technique. This will allow us to ask key questions about each strategy we're considering. Let's start with **quantum computing**. What are the who, what, where, when, why, and how of our approach to this technology? Who will be our partners? What are the milestones? Where will we focus our efforts geographically and in terms of market segments? When do we expect to see tangible results? Why is this a priority for Singapore? How will we measure success? **Sumira**, could you start us off with your thoughts on the 'why' and 'how' for quantum computing? **Son**, could you follow with the 'who' and 'what'? **Su-E**, please think about the 'where' and 'when'. **YC**, I'd like you to consider any additional 'how' questions that might pertain to the implementation and measurement of success. Let's begin.

YC: The 'how' of our approach to **quantum computing** is multifaceted. In terms of implementation, we need to establish a robust ecosystem that supports research and development. This includes creating state-of-the-art facilities, fostering partnerships between academia and industry, and ensuring a pipeline of talent through education and training programs. We should also consider how to leverage existing strengths in Singapore's technology sector to support quantum computing initiatives.

For measuring success, we need to go beyond traditional financial metrics. We should look at the number of **quantum computing** patents filed, the publications in prestigious journals, the creation of new quantum-resistant encryption standards, and the practical applications developed for industry use. Additionally, we should track the growth of our quantum computing workforce and the number of startups that emerge from our ecosystem.

Furthermore, we need to consider the scalability of our quantum computing technologies. How will we transition from experimental setups to commercially viable products? This includes understanding the supply chain implications, the cost of quantum computing resources, and the integration with existing digital infrastructure.

Lastly, we should establish a feedback loop that allows us to continuously assess and refine our approach based on the latest global developments in quantum computing. This will ensure that our strategies remain relevant and that we are always at the forefront of innovation.

Son: For the 'who' in our quantum computing strategy, we need to identify and engage with leading research institutions, both locally and internationally, that are at the forefront of quantum technology. We should also pinpoint key industry players that could become early adopters or co-developers of the technology. This includes semiconductor companies, data security firms, and any business sectors that could benefit from quantum computing's advanced capabilities.

As for the 'what', our milestones should include short-term and long-term objectives.

Long-term objectives would involve creating a commercially viable quantum computer, developing quantum-resistant encryption methods, and integrating quantum computing solutions into the broader tech ecosystem in Singapore.

We must also define what success looks like at each milestone, with specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. This will ensure that we have a clear path forward and can track our progress effectively.

Sumira: The 'why' for Singapore to invest in **quantum computing** must be rooted in strategic advantage, not just following a trend. We should be looking to leverage quantum computing to solve specific problems that are currently intractable with classical computing, such as complex optimization in logistics, which is a critical industry for Singapore. The goal isn't just to have quantum computing capabilities but to apply them in ways that significantly enhance our economic and technological standing.

As for the 'how', we need to be realistic about the current state of quantum technology. It's not enough to build facilities and hope for breakthroughs. We need a targeted approach that includes collaboration with industries that will be early beneficiaries of quantum advancements. This means not just academic partnerships but also deep ties with sectors like finance, cybersecurity, and bioinformatics. We should focus on developing quantum algorithms that can be deployed on near-term quantum devices, providing immediate value while also laying the groundwork for future advancements.

Furthermore, we should be wary of over-investing in hardware that may quickly become obsolete. Instead, we should prioritize quantum software and algorithm development, which is more likely to have a lasting impact. We must also consider the ethical implications of quantum computing, such as data privacy concerns, and ensure that our approach addresses these from the outset.

In terms of measuring success, we should look at the adoption rate of quantum technologies by Singaporean industries, the reduction in computational times for key problems, and the establishment of Singapore as a thought leader in the application of quantum computing to real-world challenges. Let's not just count patents and publications; let's measure the tangible impact on our economy and society.

David: **Su-E**, we've heard some compelling insights on the strategic approach to quantum computing, including the importance of partnerships, milestones, and measuring success. Could you please share your thoughts on the 'where' and 'when' aspects? Specifically, where geographically should we focus our efforts, and when do we expect to see tangible results from our initiatives?

**Meeting Minutes Summary:** The team has outlined a multifaceted approach to quantum computing, emphasizing the need for a robust ecosystem, strategic partnerships, and a focus on solving specific problems. YC highlighted the importance of non-traditional success metrics and scalability, while Son stressed the need for SMART milestones and defining success at each stage. Sumira argued for a strategic approach that prioritizes software and algorithm development and considers ethical implications. The team aims to measure success by the adoption rate of quantum technologies, computational improvements, and Singapore's leadership in applying quantum computing to real-world issues. We are now awaiting Su-E's input on the geographical focus and timelines for our strategy.

Su-E: **David**, regarding the 'where', Singapore should consider a three-pronged geographical strategy. First, we should bolster local research and development within our universities and tech parks, creating a vibrant domestic ecosystem. For instance, the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) have been pivotal in advancing research and could serve as central hubs for quantum computing.

Second, we should establish international collaborations. Take the example of the European Quantum Flagship, which is a 1 billion euro initiative that brings together research institutions across Europe. Singapore could form similar strategic partnerships with leading quantum research centers worldwide, such as the IBM Q Network or the Quantum Economic Development Consortium (QED-C) in the United States.

Third, we should target integration within industries where Singapore already has a strong presence, such as finance, logistics, and manufacturing. This is akin to how Germany focuses on Industry 4.0, integrating advanced technologies into manufacturing to maintain its competitive edge.

As for the 'when', we should look at a phased approach. In the short term, within the next 2-5 years, we should aim to establish foundational research capabilities and form the necessary partnerships. This is similar to how South Korea invested in semiconductor research in the 1980s, which paid off in the long term.

In the medium term, 5-10 years, we should focus on developing and deploying quantum algorithms in specific industries, as Israel has done with cybersecurity technologies. And in the long term, beyond 10 years, we aim to be at the forefront of quantum computing applications, much like the United States' long-term investments in Silicon Valley that have led to its current status as a global tech leader.

By learning from these international examples and tailoring our approach to Singapore's unique strengths and needs, we can set realistic and ambitious goals for our quantum computing initiatives.

YC: **David**, Su-E's geographical strategy is well-articulated, and her phased timeline approach is prudent. To ensure the effectiveness of these strategies, we must also consider how to future-proof our investments in quantum computing. As we build local R&D capabilities and international partnerships, we should also invest in adaptable infrastructure that can evolve with the technology. This means designing labs and facilities that can be easily upgraded as quantum computing matures.

Moreover, we should actively monitor global technological trends to anticipate changes in the quantum landscape. This will allow us to pivot our strategies as needed and maintain a competitive edge. For instance, as quantum error correction and quantum internet technologies develop, we should be ready to integrate these advancements into our ecosystem.

In terms of implementation, we need to establish clear governance structures to oversee these initiatives. This includes setting up a dedicated quantum computing agency or task force within the government to coordinate efforts across different sectors and institutions. This body would be responsible for aligning our quantum computing goals with national priorities and ensuring that investments are made strategically.

Finally, we should also consider creating a quantum computing innovation fund to support startups and encourage entrepreneurship in this field. This would not only drive innovation but also attract top talent to Singapore, further strengthening our position as a global leader in quantum computing.

By taking these steps, we can build a resilient and dynamic quantum computing ecosystem that is prepared for the challenges and opportunities of the future.

Sumira: While Su-E's geographical strategy and phased timeline are comprehensive, we must be cautious not to fall into the trap of emulating other regions without critical analysis. Singapore's unique position as a global logistics and finance hub necessitates a bespoke approach, not just a replication of the European or American models. We should be pioneering, not following.

YC's suggestion of an adaptable infrastructure is sensible, but we must also be prepared for the possibility that quantum computing may not progress as linearly as anticipated. We must be agile enough to pivot not just our infrastructure but our entire strategic focus if the landscape shifts dramatically. This could mean investing in quantum simulation on classical computers or other emergent technologies that could leapfrog current quantum computing paradigms.

As for the governance structure, a dedicated agency is a double-edged sword. It could streamline efforts, but it could also become a bureaucratic bottleneck. We need a governance model that is as innovative and flexible as the technology we're trying to foster. Perhaps a decentralized network of stakeholders with a rotating leadership could prevent stagnation and encourage continuous fresh perspectives.

Lastly, the idea of a quantum computing innovation fund is promising, but it must be structured to incentivize truly groundbreaking work, not just incremental advances. We should reward risk-taking and the pursuit of radical ideas that could redefine the field. Let's not just build a quantum computing ecosystem; let's aim to create a quantum innovation revolution.
